# Weather-App

https://weatherforecast7days.netlify.app/

Weather App is mini weather application made fully custom. It uses OpenWeatherMap API to show weather data for current location and for city we search. For current location weather, I have used Geolocation to get coordinates and put them into API to get data. As for cites we search for, I have used different API to get data about cities we search for and put their coordinates into API which takes coordinates to display weather data. For getting data in both cases, I have used async/await syntax.

Date of production: September 2021
